# Bore-DOM

Your task (whether you choose to accept it or not?) is to manipulate the DOM in the following ways.


### All actions should be executed using JavaScript unless explicitly specified otherwise.

### Objectives

1. Alter the text color of the paragraph to a shade of aqua.
2. Adjust the font size of the heading to 42 pixels.
3. Replace the text in the paragraph with the following Lorem Ipsum content:
   > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed id urna a libero interdum posuere. Donec vitae aliquet sapien. Vivamus sagittis erat a lacus tincidunt, vel feugiat odio ultrices.

4. Reduce the opacity of the 13th item to 30% transparency.
5. Modify the text of the 3rd item to read:
   > Greetings!

6. Update the image below the list to display [this image](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1470130937/photo/young-plants-growing-in-a-crack-on-a-concrete-footpath-conquering-adversity-concept.webp?b=1&s=170667a&w=0&k=20&c=IRaA17rmaWOJkmjU_KD29jZo4E6ZtG0niRpIXQN17fc=).
7. Resize the new image to a height of 250 pixels using JavaScript.
8. Integrate an additional image of your choice using Javascript innerHTML, positioning it below or to the right of the existing image.
9. Adjust the height of the new image to 280 pixels programmatically with JavaScript.
10. Append a 16th `<li>` element to the list using innerHTML, and assign it an ID following the numbering pattern of the existing list items.
11. Assign the same class as the other list items to the new `<li>` element using JavaScript.
12. Populate the new `<li>` with the following text:
   > "Never gonna give you up."
